# Huffman-Coding


Huffman Coding is one approach followed for Text Compression. Text
compression means reducing the space requirement for saving a particular text.
Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm, ie. it is a way of
compressing data without the data losing any information in the process. It is
useful in cases where there is a series of frequently occurring characters.
